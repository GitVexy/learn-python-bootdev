""" Challenge: Power Level Tracker

Your adventuring party consists of members with varying "power levels" (an integer value), representing their combat capability.

Write a function called track_power_levels that:

    Accepts:
        A list of party members represented as tuples, where each tuple contains the member's name (string) and their power level (integer). Example: [("Sally", 120), ("Jack", 85)].

    Calculates:
        The highest power level and its owner.
        The average power level of the party, rounded to 2 decimal places.
        The total sum of power levels.

    Returns:
        A string formatted as follows:

    "Highest power: NAME (LEVEL)\nAverage power: AVERAGE\nTotal power: SUM"

Example Input:

party = [("Sally", 120), ("Jack", 85), ("Luna", 150), ("Rex", 90)]

Expected Output:

"Highest power: Luna (150)\nAverage power: 111.25\nTotal power: 445"

Youâ€™ll need to consider:

    Iterating over a list of tuples to perform calculations.
    Keeping track of the "highest power level" while iterating.
    Using the length of the party to calculate averages. """
